# Mods: our improvements to the game

Everything here changes how the original game behaves, on purpose. It is kept apart from the decompiled code (`src/decomp/`), which must stay byte-for-byte faithful. The mods are built into the hook DLL (`src/hook/`, `dinput8.dll`) and switched on and off with a settings file, `open-homm5.ini`, next to the game exe.

## LAN link tuning (`net_tuning.cpp`)

**What it fixes:** slow AI turns in co-op (LAN and GameRanger games).

In a multiplayer game only the host computes the AI, and each AI move has to reach the other PCs before the next one can start. The game's network link was tuned for 2006 modems. It sends at most one small packet every 50 ms (about 5 KB/s), and a PC with nothing to send acknowledges only once per second. During AI turns the host's link is full, every PC thinks the others are lagging and slows itself down, and each AI move waits 1 to 2.5 seconds.

The mod changes three network timings on the PC that runs it:

| Setting | Game | Mod |
|---|---|---|
| `keepalive_ms`: how often an idle link sends (and so acknowledges) | 1000 | 50 |
| `send_interval_ms`: how often a link may send a packet | 50 | 10 |
| `batched_segments`: how many "segment done" reports an idle PC holds back | 3 | 0 |

Game commands still run in the same order on every PC; only the network gets faster. **Every player should run it**: each PC only speeds up what it sends.

**Measured** with the robot (two copies of the game on one PC, 2 human players plus 1 computer player, map Trèfle), seconds per AI move:

| | per AI move | typical AI turn |
|---|---|---|
| Game's timings | 2.5 s | 15–36 s |
| With the mod | 0.6 s | 2–7 s |

(Each change alone helps less: send interval only 2.2 s, keepalive only 1.6 s, both 0.9 s, all three 0.6 s.) Over the Internet the ping between the PCs comes on top.

**Settings** (`open-homm5.ini` next to the game exe; without the file the mod is on with the values above):

```ini
[net]
tuning=1             ; 0 = the game's original timings
keepalive_ms=50
send_interval_ms=10
batched_segments=0
```

The DLL's log (`open-homm5.log`) says what it changed, for example `net tuning: links may send every 10 ms (game: 50)`.

## Fast AI pathfinding (`fast_paths.cpp`, in testing, off by default)

**What it fixes:** long AI thinking late in a game on big maps (several seconds per AI move).

Late in a game, nearly all of the AI's thinking time goes into searching paths for heroes (see [docs/subsystems/ai-pathfinder.md](../../docs/subsystems/ai-pathfinder.md)). The mod keeps every step of every search and makes the steps cheaper:

- **Remembered checks.** One search can look at the same map tile over a hundred times, and each time it repeats checks that only depend on the tile ("can the hero step there?", "go ashore there?", "is there something to visit?"). The mod remembers their answers until the search ends.
- **Faster open list.** The list of tiles still to look at is sorted with the same algorithm and the same order as the game's, written out again so that it compares in place instead of copying every tile it looks at.

Because the search takes exactly the same steps, **every path and every AI decision stays the same**; only the time changes. In co-op only the host runs the AI, so the mod only matters on the host's PC, and it cannot cause a desync.

**Checked** with the robot on two of the owner's saves: all 195 big path searches (33 on a day-50 save, 162 over 5 AI turns of another) gave exactly the same result with the mod as without it. The comparison is node by node, leaving out only padding and flag bits the game never reads (`tools/robot/path_report.py`).

**Measured** (owner's day-50 save, huge map, 12 AI steps):

| | without the mod | with the mod |
|---|---|---|
| AI thinking | 22.4 s | 11.6 s |
| the longest AI step | 9.4 s | 5.1 s |
| a typical AI step (searches for the other heroes) | 1.1 s | 0.53 s |

**Settings:**

```ini
[ai]
fast_paths=1         ; 0 (default for now) = the game's own pathfinding
remember_checks=1    ; the parts can be turned off one by one (default 1)
fast_queue=1
```
