# Mods: our improvements to the game

Everything here changes how the original game behaves, on purpose. It is kept apart from the decompiled code (`src/decomp/`), which must stay byte-for-byte faithful. The mods are built into the hook DLL (`src/hook/`, `dinput8.dll`) and switched on and off with a settings file, `open-homm5.ini`, next to the game exe.

## LAN link tuning (`net_tuning.cpp`)

**What it fixes:** slow AI turns in co-op (LAN and GameRanger games).

In a multiplayer game only the host computes the AI, and each AI move has to reach the other PCs before the next one can start. The game's network link was tuned for 2006 modems. It sends at most one small packet every 50 ms (about 5 KB/s), and a PC with nothing to send acknowledges only once per second. During AI turns the host's link is full, every PC thinks the others are lagging and slows itself down, and each AI move waits 1 to 2.5 seconds.

The mod changes three network timings on the PC that runs it:

| Setting | Game | Mod |
|---|---|---|
| `keepalive_ms`: how often an idle link sends (and so acknowledges) | 1000 | 50 |
| `send_interval_ms`: how often a link may send a packet | 50 | 10 |
| `batched_segments`: how many "segment done" reports an idle PC holds back | 3 | 0 |

Game commands still run in the same order on every PC; only the network gets faster. **Every player should run it**: each PC only speeds up what it sends.

**Measured** with the robot (two copies of the game on one PC, 2 human players plus 1 computer player, map Trèfle), seconds per AI move:

| | per AI move | typical AI turn |
|---|---|---|
| Game's timings | 2.5 s | 15–36 s |
| With the mod | 0.6 s | 2–7 s |

(Each change alone helps less: send interval only 2.2 s, keepalive only 1.6 s, both 0.9 s, all three 0.6 s.) Over the Internet the ping between the PCs comes on top.

**Settings** (`open-homm5.ini` next to the game exe; without the file the mod is on with the values above):

```ini
[net]
tuning=1             ; 0 = the game's original timings
keepalive_ms=50
send_interval_ms=10
batched_segments=0
```

The DLL's log (`open-homm5.log`) says what it changed, for example `net tuning: links may send every 10 ms (game: 50)`.

## Faster co-op segments (`coop_guard.cpp`, on when every player agrees)

**What it fixes:** in co-op every AI move waits a few "segments" of 200 ms, the steps in which all PCs move the game forward together. Shorter segments make AI moves faster.

**Why it needs agreement:** the segment length decides when things happen in the game world, and every PC runs that world itself. So all PCs must use the same length, or the game desyncs.

**How:**
1. At the start of each multiplayer game, every PC's DLL sends a small hello to the others with the segment length it wants. A PC without our DLL ignores it.
2. Ten seconds in (segment 50), each DLL checks that **every** other PC sent the same wish.
3. If so, they all switch together at that segment. If not (someone has no DLL, an older one, or other settings), nobody switches and the game keeps its own timing.

`open-homm5.log` says which:

```
co-op timing: hello from player 1 (asks for 100 ms segments, protocol 1)
co-op timing: ON from segment 50: 100 ms segments (all 2 PCs agree)
```

**Measured** (robot LAN game, 2 humans + 1 AI, 8 AI turns, network tuning on):

| | game's 200 ms | 100 ms segments |
|---|---:|---:|
| per AI move | ~0.65 s | 0.53 s |
| AI hero move | ~0.84 s | 0.58 s |
| town swap | ~0.42 s | 0.34 s |

The world checksums stayed equal on both PCs (no desync). When the copies disagree, both stay OFF.

**Settings** (`open-homm5.ini`):

```ini
[coop]
guard=1           ; 0 = take no part (no hello; never switch), as without the DLL
fast_segments=1   ; 0 = ask for the game's 200 ms, so nobody switches
segment_ms=100    ; 100 or 50
```

## Fast AI pathfinding (`fast_paths*.cpp`, on by default)

**What it fixes:** long AI thinking late in a game on big maps (several seconds per AI move).

Late in a game, nearly all of the AI's thinking time goes into searching paths for heroes (see [docs/subsystems/ai-pathfinder.md](../../docs/subsystems/ai-pathfinder.md)). The mod keeps every step of every search and makes the steps cheaper:

- **Remembered checks.** One search can look at the same map tile over a hundred times, and each time it repeats checks that only depend on the tile ("can the hero step there?", "is there something to visit?", "what does a step onto it cost?"). The mod remembers their answers until the search ends, asking the game's own functions the first time.
- **Faster open list.** The list of tiles still to look at is sorted with the same algorithm and the same order as the game's, written out again so that it compares in place instead of copying every tile it looks at. At start-up the mod tests it against the game's own code and keeps the game's if anything differs.
- **Ported search core.** The search loop, the node expansion and the "relax a neighbour" step are rewritten from the game's code, step by step, calling the game's own functions in the same order. Inside it, the list of tiles still to look at is kept in a compact form (same order as the game's) and given back to the game when the search stops.
- **Fast "go ashore?" check.** Half of the remaining time was one check that scans every object of the map floor three times per tile. The mod builds, once per AI step, tables of which object covers which tile (same order rules as the game) and answers from them.

Because every search takes exactly the same steps, **every path stays the same**. In co-op only the host runs the AI, so the mod only matters on the host's PC, and it cannot cause a desync.

One subtlety: the original AI thinks in real-time slices, so how fast it runs can change what it decides, just as the original game decides a bit differently on a faster PC. The robot checks the mod with a virtual clock that removes that effect: then the original and the mod make the same decisions over whole turns.

**Checked** with the robot on four of the owner's saves (`tools/robot/path_check.py`, 4 whole AI turns each, virtual clock): every big path search gave exactly the same result as the game's own, node by node (leaving out only padding and flag bits the game never reads), plus the order of reached tiles and what is left of the open list.

**Measured** (owner's day-50 save, huge map, 4 AI turns, 85 AI moves):

| | AI thinking |
|---|---:|
| without the mod | 93.3 s |
| remembered checks + faster open list + ported search core | 44.0 s |
| + fast "go ashore?" check | 22.7 s |
| + cheaper steps (per-tile records, compact open list, fewer copies) | **16.7 s** (x5.6) |

**Settings** (`open-homm5.ini`):

```ini
[ai]
fast_paths=1         ; 0 = the game's own pathfinding (default 1 since 2026-10-24)
remember_checks=1    ; the parts, one by one (all default 1)
fast_queue=1
port_relax=1         ; the ported search core
port_search=1
port_expand=1
fast_ashore=1        ; the fast "go ashore?" check
ashore_check=0       ; 1 = also ask the game every time and log any difference (slow, for testing)
max_expansions=0     ; EXPERIMENT, CHANGES THE AI'S PATHS: expand a tile at most N times per search (0 = off)
```

`max_expansions` is not part of the exact speed-up: it is a first test of a faster search that may change the AI's paths (see the experiment in [ai-pathfinder.md](../../docs/subsystems/ai-pathfinder.md)). With 16 on the owner's day-50 save, AI thinking went from 16.7 s to 8.3 s; only the AI hero's giant long-range searches changed. On another save the AI then chose differently after a few moves. Off by default; not for real games until it has been tested much more.
